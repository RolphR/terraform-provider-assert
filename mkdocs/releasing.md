# Releasing

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions, and defined in the Workflow [release.yml](https://github.com/bschaatsbergen/terraform-provider-assert/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml).

Each release is cut by pushing a [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/) tag to the default branch.
