# Terraform Provider: Assert

The Assert provider is a Terraform provider that lets you verify values in your Terraform configurations to make sure they meet specific criteria. The provider only contains functions to assert values, and does not manage any resources.

## Documentation, questions and discussions

Official documentation on how to use this provider can be found on the 
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bschaatsbergen/assert/latest/docs).
In case of specific questions or discussions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/bschaatsbergen/terraform-provider-assert/issues/new) in this repository.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.21)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation) (optional)

## Development

### Building

1. `git clone` this repository and `cd` into its directory
2. `make` will trigger the Golang build

The provided `GNUmakefile` defines additional commands generally useful during development,
like for running tests, generating documentation, code formatting and linting.
Taking a look at it's content is recommended.

### Testing

In order to test the provider, you can run

* `make test` to run provider tests
* `make testacc` to run provider acceptance tests

It's important to note that acceptance tests (`testacc`) will actually spawn
`terraform` and the provider. Read more about they work on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/testing/acceptance-tests).

### Generating documentation

This provider uses [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/)
to generate documentation and store it in the `docs/` directory.
Once a release is cut, the Terraform Registry will download the documentation from `docs/`
and associate it with the release version. Read more about how this works on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/docs).

Use `make generate` to ensure the documentation is regenerated with any changes.

### Using a development build

If [running tests and acceptance tests](#testing) isn't enough, it's possible to set up a local terraform configuration
to use a development builds of the provider. This can be achieved by leveraging the Terraform CLI
[configuration file development overrides](https://www.terraform.io/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers).

First, use `make install` to place a fresh development build of the provider in your
[`${GOBIN}`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies)
(defaults to `${GOPATH}/bin` or `${HOME}/go/bin` if `${GOPATH}` is not set). Repeat
this every time you make changes to the provider locally.

Then, setup your environment following [these instructions](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/debugging#terraform-cli-development-overrides)
to make your local terraform use your local build.

## Releasing

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions, and it's defined in the Workflow
[release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml).

Each release is cut by pushing a [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/) tag to the default branch.
